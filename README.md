# Seanpm2001-MostDeveloped

## General Description

My Github organization for my most developed projects. It used to be an organization, now it is a repository.

### More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MostDeveloped](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-MostDeveloped) (no longer an official link)

This repository is used for the archive and development of my projects that have undergone the most development by me, and also the community. For quality reasons, mass development has to be done by me as well if the community was heavily involved.

No better definition is currently available.
